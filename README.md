# Riot-API-Demo
The files used for my Riot API Demo at http://davidskudra.ca/blog/Riot-API-Demo
Take note that MainClean.py and Main.py serve the same function, but the former doesn't include
all the print statements that help display the process.

My blog contains a full technical breakdown of the process involved to use the Riot Games API. I've recently created my own project that utilizes the basic structure I created in this demo, you can find it on my github here https://github.com/David4Danger/Ability-Power-Parity---Riot-API-Challenge-2.0

The structure included in my demo is the building blocks necessary to build something awesome like the project I linked to. I hope you'll use the demo provided or modify it to suit your needs, and make something cool!
